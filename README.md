# Spotify_Song_Recommender

Uses ML to generate a playlist containing recommended songs on Spotify. The user will need to make a Spotify for Developers account for the script to authorize the creation of the playlist and pull their data.

Although this is a finished product, I plan to refine this project using different ML methods to generate recommendations, preprocess the data differently, and work around rate-limiting issues.
