    "# **Using ML to Recommend Songs on Spotify**\n",

    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, the motivation for this project lies in the fact that, lately, I just haven't really been enjoying listening to my discover weekly. Of course, I'm sure that the models over at Spotify are much more sophisticated than what I'm writing here, but I told myself that \"even I could do better than this!\" so I figured that it might be worth the effort to try! I have already (painstakingly) collected the necessary data, and as we'll see, I'm actually shaving most of it off for the sake of simplicity lol. The goal here is primarily to practice my ML skills on a real problem (that I had) and as a nice little byproduct also get a bunch of songs to listen to.\n",

    "There seems to be a few columns in every data frame that just isn't important (i.e. `uri`). So I'll just drop those too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I ended up dropping the `genres` and `album_genres` columns because of the fact that there are just so many different genres that 1) the size of the data would explode trying to encode them using something like one-hot encoding and 2) differently-sized data frames (e.g. `filtered_playlists` and `filtered_tracks` in the cell below) just have different unique genres. For example, `filtered_track` only contains ~60 columns after exploding the `genres` column, but `filtered_playlists` ends up containing several hundred columns since there are just more songs and thus more genres in it (and that's not even including `album_genres`!). My initial thought was to perform a sort of 'inner join' on the genres to only get the ones that are in all three data frames, but I figured that approach would be a little logically inconsistent, since I'd just arbitrarily be weighing the genres of songs in my top tracks and not any other genres. Indeed, I think that exploding the `genres` and `album_genres` columns would then make my models more prone to overfitting *and* less robust to new songs (which would likely have new genres), so I'm just getting rid of this outright.\n",

    "Looks like, overall, the neural network  model performed the best in terms of avoiding both over and underfitting, so I'll just be running with that going forward. I also fit these models a few times manually, since the runtime wasn't *too* long, and I think that either the neural network model or the xgboost model would be a fine pick. The former, however, seems to be a little less robust (though it is relatively consistent  at being noticeably more accurate than the xgboost model it seems).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, I just rated everything 1-10, so the data is technically discrete, and therefore would suit a classification problem better. However, I think that since the rating is 1-10, I would prefer a regression approach where the model could rate things something like a 7.5, for example. Future work on this might somehow make this process more smooth by taking 1 of 2 approaches: either turn the problem into a softmax/softprob classification one with 10 categories or turn it into a regression problem by adding some sort of continuity to the data. The latter might be done by adding some sort of small noise to the ratings or taking a more refined approach of rating the top tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this entire process could also just be done in an unsupervised setting using something like a collaborative/content based filtering model or a hybrid.\n",

    "Also note that, since I haven't set bounds on what each model can predict, the range of any given model is technically $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, so I'll reduce that to $[0, 10]$ when making the final predictions. However, I don't think that that's necessary here since I just want to get a gauge of how each model is performing.\n",

    "Finally! You wouldn't believe how long it took to get here. Next, I'll start building a few ML models to predict the ratings of the songs in `playlists`. Note that `playlists` and `scaled_playlists` are the same thing except `scaled_playlists` has only the columns used for the ML portion of this project and is scaled. The models I'm going to try are: linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, deep neural network(s), and just for fun, nearest neighbors. The latter approach is really just to see how it compares with the more 'sophisticated' former models, but I figured it'd be a cool inclusion since the data isn't super high-dimensional.\n",

Even though XGBoost  has the lowest error of the models tried so far, I think that it might fail in a practical scenario where it has to look at songs I've never seen.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the amount of time I spent on the project as a whole and, especially, the proportion of time I spent on preprocessing (far more than I initially anticipated), I'm happy to say that I was enthusiastic about it the whole time. In fact, the longer I spent, the more rewarded I felt when something worked! There was a certain beauty in the rhythm of advancing one step, only to go back three before finally leaping forward by ten. This sort of dance taught me so many invaluable lessons in patience, something I usually struggle with when coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I navigated through each phase of the project, I encountered so many obstacles that I hadn't anticpated even as late as the morning before. These hurdles ranged from minor file read errors to major conceptual roadblocks with my data. However, each issue presented an opportunity to delve deeper into the intricacies of each tool and method I had used. Indeed,I found myself exploring new realms of knowledge, pushing the boundaries of my understanding, and honing my problem-solving skills doing something I started just because I wanted better music!\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this project was born from a personal dissatisfaction with my current situation. Transforming this dissatisfaction into a creative and productive endeavor was a really empowering experience. Not only was I able to fix an issue in my life with skills I had learned myself, but I was able to do it pretty well!\n",
    "\n",
    "There were moments where I was intensely frusturated often punctuated by huge breakthroughs, but these emotional swings added richness to my experience of this project, making the eventual success that much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about this project more generally, I realized that it's been a significant milestone in my journey as a programmer and a data scientist. The confidence I've gained is immeasurable, and I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to revisit this project, armed with new knowledge and ideas, ready to implement the advancements I've envisioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really believe that this was more than just a technical exercise; it was a transformative experience that has reshaped my perspective on learning and reinforced the idea that I would want to do this with my life. The lessons I've learned from this project extend way beyond the realm of data science; they are life lessons I'm excited to say will guide me in my future endeavors."
